# The animations.dat file specifies the animation files for the various animations in the game.  With the
# exception of a few game-specific keywords this file does not specify any animations itself, just the
# files that do.  All animation files are denoted with the '.ani' extension, so only the basename is
# required (ie: 'Player' will translate to 'Player.ani').
