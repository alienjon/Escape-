##
# {event keyword}:{custom identifying keyword}:{activating conditional keyword}:{deactivating conditional keyword}:{event data}
# In order to command what happens in the game (other than basic gameplay) the subsequent plot system is utilized.  This pseudo-
# scripting structure consists of series of plot device entries (with the PLOT keyword) followed by details that describe that
# single device.  In-game, plot devices work in the following manner: First, they remain dormant (not yet activated) until
# an activating condition is met.  This condition takes the form of a keyword that is provided by other game objects or entries
# (such as another PLOT device, a creature, or an object).  Once that keyword is provided, then the plot device is considered
# 'active'.  While active, the device will receive logic and will perform an event (as described in the plot entry - described
# below) until that event has completed.  Once the event has completed then the plot device itself will tell the other plot
# devices that it has activated.  Some plot devices (depending on the event) will cease to exist at that point (when the
# environmental lighting is configured, the event has completed immediately after setting the lighting state) but others may continue
# to exist until a subsequent 'deactivating keyword' is provided.  Consider a conversation with an NPC.  If you set that the NPC
# should say: "Find my ball!", then it would make sense for that NPC to continue saying that phrase until you have the ball
# in your possession.  Suppose that you later find that ball.  Finding the ball will signal the keyword to deactivate that dialog
# and, in all likelyhood, will activate another conversation so that when you talk to the NPC again he will say: "Thanks for
# finding my ball!"
#
# Direction:
# In the few instances where indicating a direction is needed, follow the following standard:
# up = 0, upright = 1, right = 2, downright = 3, down = 4, downleft = 5, left = 6, upleft = 7
#
# Boolean:
# Boolean values are represented in capital letters: TRUE, FALSE
#
# Plots device entries contain the following information:
#
# Event Keyword:
# The event keyword is the last keyword that is specific to a plot device.  It defines the
# type of event (what will happen) when the plot device is activated.  The list of possible
# event keywords are:
# DBG = Display a debug message as part of the event system (for testing purposes)
# ENV = Configure environmental variables.
# CON = Display a conversation.  NOTE: If a custom deactivation keyword is not provided (NULL or blank), the conversation is deactivated when the spacebar is pressed.
# PAU = Wait a certain duration (between events)
# PAG = Pause the game for a certain duration (does not affect events)
# NTE = Add a message the user can read (such as notes or tutorial messages)
# TSK = Add a task to be completed (such as something to do as part of the plot)
# MOV = Move an object to a level at a specified location.
# ADD = Add an entity to the currently loaded level.
# REM = Remove an entity from the current level.
# WLK = Tell a creature to walk to a specified location.
# HIN = Hold input (the game won't accept ANY input until the deactivation keyword is called).
# MUS = Play some music (music to be played in the background).
# SND = Play a sound.
# SET = Change creature settings.
# END = End the game and play a series of credit screens. (deactivation is ignored, as this will return to the main menu screen).
#
# Built-in keywords:
# Many things occur in-game that can be detected by plot devices.  These events will likely occur many times throughout the course
# of gameplay and, in addition to the keyword, often provide extra data to describe the event.  When the player interacts with
# another entity, for example, a built-in keyword is fired to all plot devices along with extra data that tells who interacted with
# whom.
# Player				   = This is the name/keyword for the player.  It isn't used as a standard keyword but as a keyword for other
#							 internal-game events (such as interactions).
# INTERACTION			   = An interaction has occurred.  Interactions are internal events and follow the following format:
#						     INTERACTION~{interactor}~{interactee} (note how the tilde '~' is used as a delimiter for this)
# AREA_ENTERED/AREA_EXITED = These keywords occur when the player has entered and exited an area.  Following these keywords is the name
#						     of the area; IE: AREA_ENTERED~Office
# DAMAGE				   = This is passed when an entity has taken damage.  The entity's name follows the keyword and an alternate delimiter: DAMAGE~{entity name}
# DEATH					   = This is passed when an entity has died.  The entity's name follows the keyword and an alternate delimiter: DEATH~{entity name}
# PUSHED				   = This is passed when an entity has been pushed. The entity's name follows: PUSHED~{entity name}
#
# Creature configuration keywords.
# KILL				  = Kills the specified creature.
# SET_ALIGNMENT		  = Sets the alignment of the creature. ({alignment})
# SET_FACINGDIRECTION = Sets the creature's facing direction.  Note that this does not stop the creature, so if the creature is wandering then this will likely
#					    change quickly. ({direction position} See above for direction information).  Additionally, though this can be used on the player, it is
#					    very likely the player wouldn't notice it because they are probably looking around a lot.  To have an effect of the player looking in
#						a certain direction you should hold the player's input (HIN) before setting the direction (just remember to turn it off!)
# SET_FACINGENTITY	  = Same as face direction, except that it faces another entity within the level.  As with SET_FACINGDIRECTION it will probably be needed
#						to halt player input.
# SET_SEARCHAREA      = Sets the search area dimensions. ({search span}:{search distance})
# SET_STOP			  = Stops creature movement. (no additional data required)
# SET_WANDER		  = Tells the creature to start wandering. (no additional data required)
#
# Custom Keyword:
# Plots are designated with a unique identifying keyword.  This keyword is used so that
# other game objects (plots, creatures, objects, etc...) can refer to this plot item.  If
# This plot item is being used in that way (such that its presence is the conditional for
# something else) then that keyword MUST be unique, otherwise unexpected results might
# occur.  If, however, the plot item occurs immediately or as a reaction to something else
# then this could be ignored (ie: a keyword can be put in or just skipped altogether:
# PLOT::{etc...} <- Normally the keyword would go between the 2 colons here).
#
# Activating Conditional Keyword:
# This plot device occurs when the plot device with this keyword is present.  IE:
# PLOT:tutorial_1:NULL:{etc...}
# PLOT:tutorial_2:tutorial_1:{etc...}
# If NULL or nothing (:: <- leave the 2 colons alone) is provided, such as with the first
# plot item, then the plot occurs immediately.  The second plot device, however, specifies
# the first device.  This means that the second conversation will only occur after the first
# device has been activated.
#
# Deactivating Conditional Keyword:
# The deactivating conditional keyword is identical to the activating conditional keyword
# except that it specifies when the plot item should stop activating.  This is superfluous
# for some events, so this can be ignored (NULL or ::) in those cases.  If this is not
# specified for events that do use them, then it simply means that the device will act
# indefinitely.
#
# Event Data:
# All information following the colon after the event keyword is data that is event-specific.
# The events will look for the following data:
# DBG = {additional debugging message}
# ENV = {environmental type}:{environmental data} (ie: LIGHTING:ON|OFF|TOGGLE) (note that if the ENV node's keyword is also its deactivation keyword then the environmental change will occur and then deactivate immediately without changing the state back)
# CON = {message box caption}:{portrait sprite keyword}:{conversation text} (if the sprite keyword is blank, then the text takes up the entire conversation text box.)
# PAU = {duration in ms}
# PAG = {duration in ms} (if a negative number or null then the game is paused indefinitely until the deactivation is called)
# TSK = {title for the task}:{a description of what needs to be done to complete the task}
# MOV = {level to move to keyword}:{x location to move to}:{y location to move to}
# ADD = {CREATURE/OBJECT/ITEM}:{name}:{x}:{y}:{other data for that object type} (Note: deactivation is ignored, but must be addedsimply put in null))
#		The data for an addition is based on what is needed to create that object:
#			CREATURE -> {animation template name}:{alignment string}:{health int}:{defense int}
#			OBJECT	 -> {animation template name}
#			ITEM	 -> {NEED TO IMPLEMENT}
# REM = {name of entity to remove} (Note: deactivation is ignored, but must be added (simply put in null))
# WLK = {name of creature,string}:{x position,int}:{y position,int} (Note that if the keyword provided is not that of a creature an warning will occur.  Also, the deactivation for this keyword is ignored.)
# HIN = none
# MUS = {name of song to play in 'Audio/' folder}:{number of times to loop (set to negative 1 for infinite)}:{fade-in time}:{fade-out time}
# SND = {name of song to play in 'Audio/' folder}:{number of times to loop (set to negative 1 for infinite)} (note that there is NO fading for sound, only music)
# SET = {name of the creature}:{creature settings keyword}:{creature settings data} (for information on the creature settings keywords and their data, see above)
# END = {credit sprite image filename}~{fadein}~{fadeout}:{...}:{...} (Following the deactivation keyword is a series of delimiter separated image filenames to
#		display as credits).  Each image is appended with two integers that represent the fadein and fadeout times (respectively and in milliseconds) for that
#		screen.  Values of 0 show or remove the image immediately.
#
# Environment Device Options:
# The environmental plot device has several game/meta-game variables it is able to manipulate.  The list of those is recorded here.
# LIGHTING		 - This toggles the current state of showing shadows in the game.  Available options are ON, OFF, and TOGGLE.
# DISPLAY_HEALTH - This enables or disables the showing of a health display for a provided creature.  Format follows: :DISPLAY_HEALTH:{status}:{creature name}
# 				   The status can be either ADD or REMOVE and the creature name is... well... obvious ;-)

CON:player_damage_2:player_damage_1:NULL:Tutorial:Tutorial:Although naturally slow, when a zombie spots a human they can't seem to help themselves.  They will chase after you immediately. They are hungry for brains, after all.
CON:player_damage_3:player_damage_2:NULL:Tutorial:Tutorial:After a zombie spots you, you can try to run away from it.  They will only follow you as long as you are in their line of sight.  If they catch up to you, though, then they will grab onto you (you won't be able to move) and start doing damage.  However, you're not a complete weakling and can fend them off for a little while before getting really hurt.

CON:player_damage_4:player_damage_3:NULL:Tutorial:Tutorial:This health screen you see in the top right corner of the screen represents how much strength (the green bar) and health (the red bar) you have remaining.  As a zombie does damage to you your strength will be diminished first, but if you lose it all then you will start to lose your health.  Lose all health and you will die.
CON:player_damage_5:player_damage_4:NULL:Tutorial:Tutorial:The good news is that your strength will return to you over time, but your health will remain low unless you can find a way to heal yourself.  Additionally keep your eyes open for items to increase/enchance your strength, keep it full for a period of time, as well as upgrades to your flashlight.
CON:player_damage_6:player_damage_5:NULL:Tutorial:Tutorial:If a zombie does happen to latch onto you, however, then not all is lost.  You can also try to push them away by interacting with them.  Different zombies will have different levels of strength, so it is likely that you will have to press the interaction key several times before they get pushed backwards.  If more than one zombie is on you, you will need to look at each of them and push each one away.  Try not to get overwhelmed!
