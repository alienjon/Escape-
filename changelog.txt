Version 0.1
-------------
Implement main menu
	high score screen
	option screen
	new game
	other?

Graphics
*	Implement animations
	Evaluate where I want graphics to go (ask Dan for input?)
*	Graphics are a bit choppy - fix this
*	Implement loading screens

Audio
*	Implement playing multiple (maybe random) songs
*	listen to more music selections and add them for playing

Gameplay
*	Add point +/- pickups
	review other pick ups (maybe a multiplier, speed)
*	remove items (or simplify)
	add effect for picking up keys
*	make sure exiting at end of level works (it currently does not)
	Implement better widgets to display game info (score, remaining time, other? (maybe currently active effects?))
*	Check player speed (test faster/slower?)
*	Check point values (are they too much/too little)
	Check level difficulties (there seems to be a big variety in map difficulty (is it based on size?)) and stabilize
	Implement options in in-game menu (have it be able to set video size, vsync, antialiasing, music volume, sound volume, others?)
	
Backend
*	Implement boost libs to read filesystem (this way I can read files in a directory, instead of having to hard code things like audio files)
*	Implement updating the video size

Quality Control
	Review graphics
	Review control response
	Review sound/music implementation
