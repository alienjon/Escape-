Thoughts
--------
removing most powerups for now... they seem to make things a bit too wonky
	I'll probably want to remove the items idea (and item selection) if powerups stay off...  if not, find an easier way of using them?


Suggested controls:
F1: toggle debug mode (displays debug info, such as search areas, collision areas, etc...)
F2 (with debug enabled): Engine info
ESCAPE: Display game options
ALT+ENTER: toggle fullscreen
CTRL + p: print screen
arrow keys move around

Version 0.2
-------------
Implement main menu
	high score screen
	option screen
	new game
	other?

Gameplay
	Implement better widgets to display game info (score, remaining time, other? (maybe currently active effects?))
	Check player speed (test faster/slower?)
	Check point values (are they too much/too little)
	Check level difficulties (there seems to be a big variety in map difficulty (is it based on size?)) and stabilize

Version 0.1
-------------
Graphics
*	Implement animations
	Evaluate where I want graphics to go (ask Dan for input?)
*	Graphics are a bit choppy - fix this

Audio
	What other sounds could be implemented
	Implement playing multiple (maybe random) songs
	listen to more music selections and add them for playing

Gameplay

	remove items (or simplify)
