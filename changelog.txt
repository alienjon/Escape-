Version 0.1
-------------
Implement main menu
	high score screen
	option screen
	new game
	other?

Graphics
*	Implement animations
	Evaluate where I want graphics to go (ask Dan for input?)
*	Graphics are a bit choppy - fix this
*	Implement loading screens

Audio
*	Implement playing multiple (maybe random) songs
*	listen to more music selections and add them for playing

Gameplay
*	Add point +/- pickups
*	review speed - too fast right now (collide through walls)
	review other pick ups (maybe a multiplier, speed)
		Make everything a single 'switcher' that will cycle through all possible effects?
*	remove items (or simplify)
	add effects (picking up keys - what the keys do, countdown - sound and big numbers, effects for increasing/decreasing score)
*		Make keys enlarge and shrink
		Add effect to show that the player has the key (?key lifts off maze and moves to side of the screen/near timer?)
		Add effect for when the timer is below 10 seconds (numbers grow and then shrink slowly over the course of the second - change color to red?)
		Add effect for when things are picked up
*	make sure exiting at end of level works (it currently does not)
*	Implement better widgets to display game info (score, remaining time, other? (maybe currently active effects?))
*	Check player speed (test faster/slower?)
*	Check point values (are they too much/too little)
*	Check level difficulties (there seems to be a big variety in map difficulty (is it based on size?)) and stabilize
*	Implement options in in-game menu (have it be able to set video size, vsync, antialiasing, music volume, sound volume, others?)
	Consider turning game (maybe fork it to try it out) into more of a pacman style game (no pickups, only +point scores but more complicated maps/tougher time limits?
	
Backend
*	Implement boost libs to read filesystem (this way I can read files in a directory, instead of having to hard code things like audio files)
*	Implement updating the video size
