CODING
------
I did most of the coding, and the little I didn't do was inspired from various books and online tutorials, including:
Accelerated C++, Lazy Foo Productions (http://www.lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php), Rene Nyffenegger (adp-gmbh.ch/cpp/common/base64.html),
blackspawn's geometrical triangulation calculations (www.blackspwan.com)

GRAPHICS
--------
The tilesets and most 2D graphics were found at Reiner's website: reinerstileset.4players.de
He has an excellent collection.

The rest of the poor excuses for 2D artwork was done by me using The GIMP.  Image fonts used the GIMP fonts: "Marked Fool" and "It Wasn't Me"
Should you be crazy enough to use them elsewhere I only ask you include my name with it and a link to my contact information
(my website is preferred: cyberneticpitstop.zapto.org - See CONTACT for additional information)
