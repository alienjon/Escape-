# The levels file is merely a list of the names of each of the levels.  As the level
# files themselves are merely {level_name}.lvl, only the names are needed here.  The
# order is important, with the first name listed being the first level, the second name
# is the second level and so on consecutively.  Each line is completely considered the name
# of the level, so end the name with a new line.  Commented lines (lines beginning with a
# '#' are ignored as are empty lines.
