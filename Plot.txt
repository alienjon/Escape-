The game starts off with a short conversation between the tutorial and the player.

Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Welcome to the Escape! presentation demo!"
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "This demonstration will present the alpha 1.0 state of the game.  This means that although many features are implemented there are many more which need to/could be added, testing that needs to be done, and performance improvements (not to mention bug fixes!)."
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Tutorial - Basic Controls 1\n\nPress the directional arrows to move the player."
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Tutorial - Basic Controls 2\n\nThe player is always looking towards the cursor, so if you move to the left but the cursor is to the right of the player then the player will move backwards."
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Tutorial - Basic Controls 3\n\nPress a mouse button or the spacebar to try interacting with your surroundings.  Not everything can be interacted with, so make sure you explore!"
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Now to get started, please let me introduce you to the player: 'you'."
Message - {Player Portrait} "Hello, World!"
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "Shut up.  Now, let's make this at least a little interesting.  You're a courier and are currently in the top floor of a corporate office building.  You came here to pick up a package (in a nearby office) and deliver it."
Message - {Player Portrait} "That sounds easy enough."
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "During the demo, some things will happen in order to show off various parts of the engine and the game."
Message - {Player Portrait} "You're not going to mess with me, are you?"
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "The hope of presenting the game in this way is to allow people to test out the basic gameplay and concepts I have of the game and to receive feedback, criticisms, and suggestions."
Message - {Tutorial Portrait} "My contact information is in an included 'CONTACT' file.  I hope to hear from you and you enjoy what exists of the game so far!"
Message - {Player Portrait} "Wait, what do you want me to do again?"
Message - {Player Portrait} "... Hello?"
Message - {Player Portrait} "Guess we'll have to figure this one out ourselves..."

The short message should say: "Find the Package"

- Stuff in the level -
There is a door to the west.
If the player interacts with it without DEMO_PACKAGE_1 then the player says - "Didn't that guy say something about getting a package?  I think it's somewhere on this floor..."
If the player interacts with it with DEMO_PACKAGE_1 then a tutorial message thanks the user for playing and asks for feedback.  The game then ends in success.

There are a few desks.
If the player interacts with any desk in this area then she says - "Hmm... Doesn't look like anything is here."

One desk in particular, when interacted with, will have the player say:
"Hey, there's a note in the drawer here!"
The player will then receive a letter titled: "Try the southern door all the way to the east."
A tutorial message will then pop up: "You just picked up a letter!  Letters can be viewed by pressing 'Escape' and selecting 'Letters' on the left."

There are windows 'off screen' but to the right of the screen (just area's, nothing the player can see)
If the player interacts in an area to the east, then she says - "These are huge windows!  Wow... look of that skyline!"

There are a couple of doors around the area, interacting with different ones should have the player say:
"Says 'closet'.  Locked anyway..."
"Looks like an office, but it's locked."
"What is this, Silent Hill?  Another locked door..."
"There's glass in this door.  I can see the room is empty."

===================================================================================================================================
Second Area - Executive's Office
Area is a small office There is a door to the north, a desk and chair to the south, and windows around the east and south edges.  A package sits on the ground next to the desk.
There are lights coming from out the window

- Stuff in the level -
There is a door to the north
If the player has picked up the package and the flashlight then interacting with the door will open it and the player can leave
If the player has not picked up the package then the player will say: "Before I leave I should grab that package."
If the player has picked up the package but not the flashlight, then interacting with the door will have the player say: "If it's really dark in here with all these windows, how will I see in the rest of the building? ... I should see if there's something around I could use."

There is a desk and a chair to the south.
If the player interacts with either, nothing happens.

There are windows on the eastern and southern walls.
If the lights in the building are out, then the player says: "Wow, looks like power went out throughout the whole city...  I wonder why there isn't any backup power?"
By default, the player will say: "The view is even nicer in here!"

If the player interacts with the package, then the package is removed from the level and added to the player's inventory.
A short message should say: "Package Picked Up"
The player will then say: "Ok, um... here we go... Yeah, this looks like the package that guy was talking about.  I don't remember him saying what I needed to do with it, though."
"Well, maybe he'll tell us something back in the first room."
The player's movement is then halted (the player can't accept input)
The game should wait for about 2 seconds (pause timer)
A loud 'ZAP' sound should then play.
The player should then say: "Ah! What the hell was that?!"
The game should wait about 2 seconds.
The 'overhead lights' should then flicker on and off for about 4 seconds (off for about .25 seconds, on for about .5 seconds, off for about .10 seconds, on for about .25 seconds, off for about .75 seconds, on for about .25 seconds, then off altogether.
The game should wait another 1 second.
The player should then say: "Oh what he hell is this?!  Is this what that guy meant by 'messing with me'?"
The player should then say: "Well crap...  I can't see a damned thing in here.  I can see out the window's, though."
A loud zombie groan should then be played in the background.
The player should then say: "... um... what was that?"
A flashlight should then appear somewhere in the light from the windows.
The player should then say: "Was that there before?"
A door closing sound should then play.
The player should then say: "Ok, this is just getting weird.  I'm getting out of here!"
The player can the be given control back.
A short message should say: "Get The Flashlight"

If the player interacts with the flashlight when it is visible then she should say: "I don't know where this came from, but it seems to work.  This should help me see in here."
A tutorial message should pop up saying: "The flashlight will show you dark areas immediately in front of you.  Therefore it will always light up whichever direction you are currently facing."
A tutorial message continues: "It can be toggled on and off by pressing the 'F' key."
A short message should say: "Go Into The Other Room"

===================================================================================================================================

Third Area - The Top Floor: Revisited
The same area as the first area. Except the 'overhead lights' are out.

As the player re-enters this area, she says: "Not surprised that the lights are out here too.  Looking out the window it seems that all the lights in the city are out..."
A green zombie then walks through the a small area of light and down a hallway (out of sight).
A loud zombie groan should then play.
The player should then say: "Hey mister, you okay?  Hmm, he didn't responded.  Maybe he didn't hear me?  He sounds sick."
The player should then say: "Oh wait, I get it... Lights out; creepy groaning; green, sickly looking people walking around."
The player should then say: "This is a zombie game, isn't it?  What the fuck!  I didn't sign up for this!  I'm totally not doing this.  I want out now!"
A short message should say: "Find the Person"
The game should pause for long enough so that the player can read the message.
The player should then say: "Oh FUCK no.  I'm NOT getting involved in this."
The tutorial should then say: "I think it would be fun!"
The player should then say: "Oh great.  Now this asshole's back."
The player should then say: "Hey, dick!  What the fuck, man!  NOT cool!  I'm NOT doing this!"
The tutorial should then say: "Need I remind you that you're on the top floor of an office building right now?  How do you plan on getting home if I don't help you?"
The player should then say: "But this isn't... that's not how... that doesn't..."
The player should then say: "... ... ..."
The player should then say: "I hate you so much right now."
The player should then regain control.

If the player interacts with any doors then she should say: "I would LIKE to leave, but I gotta find this zombie first..."

Once the player 'sees' the zombie (the zombie is in the player's search area) then the player should say: "There, Mr. Bait-n-Switch.  I found this bastard.  Now what?"
The player should lose control.
A loud zombie groan should play.
The player should then say: "Christ!  He's attacking me!"


The zombie should then run over to and grab the player.
A tutorial message should then display: "Although naturally slow, when a zombie spots a human they can't seem to help themselves.  They will chase after you immediately. They are hungry for brains, after all."
A tutorial message should then display: ""
Toggle the healthbar widget on.
A tutorial message should then display: "If a zombie has grabbed you, though, you will start losing strength (as indicated by the bar in the upper right).  If this bar empties completely then you will have lost all strength to resist and the zombie will eat your brains... Good for him, bad for you.  The game will also be over."
A tutorial message should then say: "Luckily, you can easily push him away by pressing the left mouse button or the spacebar.  Your strength will then slowly return over time."
A tutorial message should then say: "As you play, keep your eyes open for various items which will increase your strength, keep it full for a while, and for upgrades to your flashlight."
Toggle the healthbar widget so it stays on.
The player should then say: "That's all well and good, but GET THIS THING OFF ME!"
When this zombie is pushed down, he won't get back up.
The player then says: "Whew!  That guy STINKS!  He's really falling apart.  I doubt I'll be as lucky with stronger ones."
The player then says: "Ok, I'm so done here.  Lets get out of this place!"
A short message should then say: "Escape!"

If the eastern door is interacted with, the door will open and the player can leave.

If any other door is interacted with, the player will say: "I want out of here!", "No, this is an office.  I want the stairs!", "A closet?!  Nonononono, I'm not hiding in a closet with zombies around!", "This isn't it either.  I think the stairs are to the west."
